        <p><span class="much">All students at the WISER Girls Secondary School live full-time on our campus during the school year and receive all of the resources they need to be healthy, safe, and empowered. WISER believes that it is not enough to offer opportunities for academic excellence if students must also fear for their physiological well-being. By eliminating all physical and monetary barriers and providing psychosocial and emotional support, WISER students have the freedom and peace of mind to dedicate their immense intellectual energy and determination to reaching their full potential.</span></p><span class="much"> </span>
        <p><span class="much">WISER girls receive three nutritious meals each day with ingredients from our on-campus garden, clean water from our on-campus filtration system, soap and hygiene products, clothing, shoes, and school uniforms. WISER provides each girl with her own bed and mosquito net in our secure on-campus dorms. WISER&rsquo;s sanitation system ensures all students have access to indoor plumbing, preventing waterborne illness which occurs frequently outside our campus and allowing them to manage their periods.</span></p><span class="much"> </span>
        <p><span class="much">Girls at WISER participate in &ldquo;Houses of Wisdom&rdquo; &ndash; small psychosocial support groups of 12-15 students who meet weekly to discuss health and community challenges in a safe environment. All students also engage in staff-led guidance and counselling sessions, one-on-one sessions with our guidance &amp; counselling faculty leader, and bi-weekly school-wide discussions on sexual and reproductive health with a faculty facilitator. WISER has 12 peer counsellors who provide mentorship to their fellow students and facilitate the weekly Houses of Wisdom meetings.</span></p><span class="much"> </span><button class="learnMore">Learn more</button>

        <p><span class="much">WISER provides quality education at the WISER Girls Secondary School, an all-girls boarding school in Muhuru Bay, during the Kenyan academic school year. We provide all of the academic resources girls need to be successful: textbooks, story books, school supplies, and laboratory equipment. We are particularly dedicated to STEM excellence and provide all of our girls with access to a computer lab, robotics and engineering clubs, and two university-quality science labs where our faculty teach using hands-on learning.</span></p><span class="much"> </span>
        <p><span class="much">WISER girls build on their classroom knowledge through a variety of experiential learning opportunities. Through regional academic and athletic competitions against other schools, WISER girls demonstrate that girls can compete (and win) against boys, challenging gender norms and building their self-esteem in the process. Through the Science and Engineering club, girls design solutions to community-identified problems and elevate their personal sense of self and social valuation through sharing these solutions with community members. Girls take these projects to regional and then national Science Fairs, subverting expectations for girls in STEM. Through engaging computer skills courses and a coding and design-thinking bootcamp with Kenyan women in STEM, WISER girls will be exposed to role models and overcome traditional barriers to STEM career pathways. WISER girls also participate in communications, environmental, and business clubs to learn inside and outside of the classroom.</span></p><span class="much"> </span><button class="learnMore">Learn more</button>

Approximately 75% of them are from the area immediately surrounding WISER&rsquo;s campus in Muhuru Bay and the remaining 25% are from across Kenya. Over 40% of this population has been orphaned by HIV/AIDS.

Additionally, WISER students lead, annually, a series of family planning and SRH trainings for primary school students aged 11 to 15 at eight local primary schools. Outside of the schools, these same girl leaders from WISER reach thousands of community members in local churches and community spaces through single-day, 8-hour, interactive trainings supported by a WISER teacher and local nurse. These sessions can reach everyone from youth as young as eight years old and adult men and women in their eighties. The content of the sessions is adjusted accordingly and small group work is often used as a solution to reaching crowds containing particularly disparate populations.</span></p><span class="much"> </span>

We partner with and build capacity in local women and community members, who manage and operate the kiosks. 93% of community members using the current clean water system report improved health outcomes.

          <p>Mercy Adhiambo, (WISER Class of 2014), represented WISER at the first in-person convening of the Girls Opportunity Alliance, an organization of the Obama Foundation whose goal is to lift up the work being done around the world to empower adolescent girls through education. She shared with leaders in the field at the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago about how WISER&rsquo;s holistic approach to girls&rsquo; education is changing Muhuru Bay, and she is committed to continuing the work that changed her life.</p>

          <p>Linah Samrah (WISER Class of 2018) watched WISER&rsquo;s very first class celebrate their graduation as a child in 2013, and she was determined to match their accomplishment one day. Now, Linah is not only a WISER graduate, but has just finished the WISER alumni internship program--gaining work experience while being mentored by WISER faculty. She plans to pursue a university education in clinical medicine.</p>

          <p>Winnie Bellah (WISER Class of 2014) was in primary school when she noticed something disturbing: girls in her community almost never finished secondary school. But Winnie was among the first class of students at WISER, and she not only finished high school, she finished university, too. Now, she&rsquo;s teaching at a primary school just down the road from WISER, showing her students what is possible through education.</p>
          <p>Quote: &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s good for WISER alumni to give back. We are supporting others so that they can rise up, the same way we rose up because of support from others.&rdquo;</p>
