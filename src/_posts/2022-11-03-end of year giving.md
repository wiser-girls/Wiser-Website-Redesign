### WISER Launches Its End of Year Donation Drive

We are excited to announce our participation in the global day of giving, **Giving Tuesday, on November 29th.&nbsp;**Throughout November, we will be sharing exciting campaign updates and new content via email and WISER'S social media channels. Thanks to the support of our donors, WISER has provided life-changing education and resources for girls in rural Kenya. **Our flagship program, the WISER Girls Secondary School in Muhuru Bay, Kenya, has seen 312 girls graduate since its establishment in 2010. More than half of these girls have gone on to university.**

As WISER moves towards the future, we are committed to continuing to provide our students with all the support and resources they need to thrive in academics and life. WISER girls are equipped with all school materials, healthy food options, uniforms, and other essential resources as they live full-time on our campus, free of charge. Outside of excellent academics, students also receive healthcare, medicine, vaccines, and sanitary supplies. WISER also provides comprehensive, fact-based, and affirming sexual and reproductive health training. We are setting up students with everything they need to succeed and transform their lives and communities.&nbsp;

**This year we are looking to raise $100,000.00 to support our school, students, and mission.&nbsp;**

But we don't have to wait until Giving Tuesday to start reaching our goal. We feel that every day should is an opportunity to impact the lives of these girls-and therefore Every Day can be a Giving Day. A lot happens at the end of the year, with the holidays and work and school. Instead of having yet another item to add to your list of "to do's" that last week of November, we encourage you to make your donation today and be done with it. Or, **if&nbsp; you are looking to increase your impact,** then consider making a monthly donation. *For a limited time, our partner at Global Giving is matching new monthly contributions (up to $200 per unique donor)*. These monthly donations can help provide WISER with funds throughout the year.
